# Project Description
The Nobel Prize is the world's most well known scientific award. It is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace every year. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901.

We will find out more about the prize nomenation! What characteristics do the prize winners have? How long they live? Which country gets it most often? Has anybody gotten it twice? 

The dataset used in this project is from DEVAKUMAR K. P. on Kaggle.

In this project, we will use data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.
